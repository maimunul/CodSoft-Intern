## Introduction
This project aims to provide insights into the Titanic dataset using machine learning techniques. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the [Spaceship Titanic: Predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) competition.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maimunul/Titanic-Predictions-with-Machine-Learning-Models.git
cd Titanic-Predictions-with-Machine-Learning-Models
pip install -r requirements.txt
