## Introduction
This project aims to provide insights into the Titanic dataset using machine learning techniques. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the [Spaceship Titanic: Predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) competition.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maimunul/Titanic-Predictions-with-Machine-Learning-Models.git
cd Titanic-Predictions-with-Machine-Learning-Models
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Explore the dataset using Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ folder.
Run the preprocessing scripts located in the src/ directory.
Train models and evaluate their performance.
Models
This repository includes various models such as:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
LightGBM
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Neural Networks
Results
The models will be evaluated based on accuracy and other metrics. A detailed comparison will be presented in the notebooks.
